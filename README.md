# Seinfeld TV Script Generation

## Overview

The goal is to generate new Seinfeld TV scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The neural network is trained on a portion of the Seinfeld dataset, consisting of scripts from 9 seasons. The trained model learns patterns from this data and generates a new, "fake" TV script in the style of Seinfeld.

## Project Files

- **dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and instructions.
- **helper.py**: Python script with helper functions for data processing and model training.
- **problem_unittests.py**: Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functions.
- **dlnd_tv_script_generation.html**: HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook.

## Running the Notebooks

To explore and run the code, you need to have the following:

- Python installed
- Jupyter Notebook installed

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SmartHacks25/Generate-TV-scripts.git
    cd Generate-TV-scripts
    ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and generate Seinfeld-like TV scripts.
